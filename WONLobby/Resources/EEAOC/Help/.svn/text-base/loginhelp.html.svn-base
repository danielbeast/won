<h4><a name="_Ref10356744">Logging on to Sierra Online</a></h4>

Sierra Online user name, click the <a href=#_Ref10356796><i>Create New User</i></a> button to create one.
If this is your first login on this computer for this user name, the
<a href=#_Ref10356800>Terms of Use</a> dialog will appear; you must agree to the Terms of Use

the <i>Remember Password</i> check box to save your password for future logins.</p>

appropriate default lobby server/room if not.  If you hold down the <i>control</i> key when you click
the <i>Login</i> button, you will be able to select a room rather than automatically joining.</p>
