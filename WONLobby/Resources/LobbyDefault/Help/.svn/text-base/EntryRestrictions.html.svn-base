<h3 align=center>Game Entry Restrictions</h3>
<p>When a game is created, entry restrictions may be attached by the host and will limit which
users can join the game.  Games with entry restrictions are marked with an appropriate
<a href="Icons.html">icon</a> in the <a href="GameBrowser.html#_RefColumns">Info</a> column of
the game browser.  There are three types of entry restrictions:</p>

<p><b><u><a name="_RefAsk">Ask To Join</a></u></b><br>
As the host, you will receive
a prompt in your game chat window whenever a user wishes to join your game.  You must click on
<i>accept</i>  to allow entry or <i>reject</i> to immediately
deny entry.&nbsp; As a user, you must <i>Ask to Join</i> and await the reply.</p>

<p><b><u><a name="_RefInvite">Invite Only</a></u></b><br>
  As the host, you may invite users
by using the <a href="Chat.html#_RefCommands">invite chat command</a> or by right-clicking on a user
in a user list and selecting <i>invite</i>.
Only users invited by the game host may join the game.  Games you have been invited to join are
marked differently than games you have not been invited to join.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><a name="_RefPassword">Password</a></u></b><br>
  As the host, you must specify the password when the game
is created. Users must supply the correct password into the dialog box before they can join the game.&nbsp;</p>
