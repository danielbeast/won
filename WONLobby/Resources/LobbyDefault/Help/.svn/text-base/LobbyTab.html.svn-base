<h3 align=center>Lobby Tab</h3>
<p>The Lobby Tab is used to join and host games via Sierra Online.  The upper portion is a
<a href="GameBrowser.html">Game Browser</a> that lists any games that are currently available
on your Lobby server.  The lower portion contains <a href="Chat.html">Chat</a> for your current
Lobby server room.  Between the Game Browser and Chat is the Status Bar.</p>

<p>The Status Bar displays your current Lobby server, room, and a count of the users in the room.
It also contains a <i>Change Room</i> button on the left, and two splitter buttons on the right.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefSplitter">Controlling Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>You may control the real estate used for the game browser and chat on the Lobby Tab.  The status
bar can be clicked and dragged up or down to control the size of the game browser
and chat.  Or you may use the splitter buttons on the right side of the status bar.  Clicking the
left button will maximize chat, hiding the game browser.  Clicking the right button will maximize
the game browser, hiding chat.  Clicking either button again after maximizing will return the
Lobby Tab to its dual display.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefChangeRoom">Changing and Creating Rooms</a></h4>
<p>You may click the <i>Change Room</i> button on the status bar to change your
Lobby server/room
or to create a new room.  Doing so displays the Change Room Dialog.  The Change
Room Dialog displays
a list of available servers, with your current server (if any) selected.  You may click on a server
to open or close the display of its rooms.  Select a server and/or room and click <i>Join Room</i>
to join that server and room.  If no room is selected, you will be joined to the default room on
the server.</p>

<p>You may click <i>Create Room</i> on the Change Room Dialog to create a new room.  New rooms are
always created on your current server.  Once clicked, the New Room Dialog is displayed.  Enter a room
name and select <i>Create Room</i> to crate the new room or cancel to abort.
Optionally, you may
select <i>Password Protect</i> to attach a password to your room.  Users joining your room will be
prompted to enter the password before being allowed to join.</p>

<p>You may click <i>Cancel</i> to abort the Change Room Dialog.</p>
