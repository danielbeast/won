<h3 align=center>Friends List</h3>
<p>You can use the Friends Lists to keep track of your online buddies, and you can have up to 255
users on it at any given time.  Online friends are sorted to the top of the list.
Offline friends are displayed as disabled text and sorted to the bottom.  Friends that are
currently in a game will have the <a href="Icons.html">In Game Icon</a> displayed next to their
name.</p>

<p>There are 4 buttons at the bottom of the friends list: <i> Add</i> (add a friend),
<i> Del</i> (delete a friend), <i>
></i> (locate a friend), and <i> >></i> (locate all friends).</p>

<h4><a name="_RefDetect">Detecting Friends</a></h4>
<p>Detecting your friends depends on whether they are on your Lobby server or on
a different Lobby server.  Friends that join, leave, or enter games on your server will have their
statuses in the Friends List updated automatically.  Friends on other servers will not.  You can check
the status of friends on other servers at any time by selecting the <i>Refresh (>>)</i> button at
the bottom of the Friends List.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefLocate">Locating Friends</a></h4>
<p>Locating Friends searches the Sierra
Online servers.  There are two ways to locate a friend.  You may select a friend in the
Friends list
and click the <i>Locate (>)</i> button below.  Or you can right-click on a friend in
the Friends List and select <i>Locate</i>.</p>

When you locate friends, their statuses are put in the <a href="Chat.html#_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a>
to the left of the Friends List.  If they are on your server,  a message/link to their current room
and the game they are playing (if they are in a game) will be displayed.  If they are on another server,
a message/link to that server will be displayed.  If they are not online, a message to that effect will
be displayed.
