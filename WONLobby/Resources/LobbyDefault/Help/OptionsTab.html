<h3 align=center>Options Tab</h3>
<p>The Options Tab allows you to configure aspects of the multiplayer matchmaking lobby.  Options
are set separately for each user name of Sierra Online. Other Multiplayer (LAN and Direct play)
have a single set of options.  Available options and their use are described below.  Note that
some options apply to both Sierra Online and Other Multiplayer; other options apply only to
Sierra online or to Other Multiplayer.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefAccounts">Account Maintenance</a></h4>
<p>You can maintain your Sierra Online account on the Sierra Online Options Tab.  The right side
allows you to update all account information except your login name.  Note that you must enter your
current password before you can query or update your account.  Once you have entered your current
password, you can select <i>Query Account</i> to retrieve your existing account information.  You
can then update your account information and select <i>Update Account</i> to change your account
information.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefNetwork">Advanced Network Options</a></h4>
<p>The <b>Choose Network Adapter</b> and <b>LAN Broadcast Port</b> settings are advanced network
settings.  <i>It is highly recommended you do not change these settings unless you are comfortable
with your Internet set up and have a strong understanding of networking issues</i>.  All advanced
network options are available in the <i>Advanced Network Options</i> box, located in the lower left
of the Options tab.</p>

<p><i>Choose Network Adapter</i> is available on both the Sierra Online and Other Multiplayer
Options Tabs.  It will display a dialog that allows you to change the network adapter on your
machine used for online play.  This is only necessary if your machine has multiple network adapters.</p>

<p><i>LAN Broadcast Port</i> is available only on the Other Multiplayer
Options Tab.  You can use it to specify the port used to broadcast LAN games.  Changing this port
is only necessary when the default port is conflicting with other applications on your LAN.  Note that
all users on the LAN need to use the same LAN broadcast port to see games.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefHosting">Checking Your Ability to Host Games</a></h4>
<p>The Options Tab displays information about your ability to host games and lets you know if
you are behind some types of <a href="Security.html">Internet Security</a>.  The lower left of the
Options Tab contains a box labeled <i>Advanced Network Options</i> which contains a read-only display
of <i>Local Address</i> and <i>Public Address</i>.  If these two fields do not match, some type of
Internet security is present between your machine and the Internet.</p>

<p>If the <a href="Icons.html">TAC Icon</a> is displayed next to <i>Public Address</i>, then you will
most likely be unable to host games for Sierra Online or Direct Connection; other players on the
Internet will be unable to connect to your machine.</p>
